# 🛠️ Refactoring Challenge: User Management API

This document outlines the **comprehensive improvements** made to the legacy `messy-migration` codebase. The focus was on enhancing **security**, **maintainability**, **readability**, and **RESTful API practices**.

## 🚨 Major Issues Identified

### 🔐 Critical Security Flaws

| Issue                    | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQL Injection**        | All queries used raw string formatting with unsanitized input. |
| **Plain Text Passwords** | User passwords were stored and compared in plaintext.          |
| **No Auth Protection**   | Endpoints lacked authentication/authorization enforcement.     |

### ⚙️ Poor Code Structure

* **Global DB Connection**: Shared `sqlite3.Connection` and `Cursor` objects led to concurrency issues.
* **Tight Coupling**: DB logic was tangled inside route handlers.
* **Improper Request Parsing**: Used `request.get_data()` + `json.loads()` instead of `request.get_json()`.

### 🧱 Lack of Best Practices

* No input validation (email, password, missing fields).
* Raw string responses instead of structured JSON.
* Incorrect HTTP status codes used.
* Passwords exposed in API responses.
* `app.run(debug=True)` used in production (a major risk!).

---

## ✅ Key Improvements

---

### 1. 🔒 Security Enhancements

#### ✅ SQL Injection Prevention

* Replaced all string-formatted SQL queries with **parameterized queries** using `cursor.execute("...", (value,))`.

#### ✅ Password Hashing

* Passwords are now:

  * **Hashed** using `generate_password_hash()` before storage.
  * **Verified** using `check_password_hash()` during login.

#### ✅ Password Hash Hidden

* `get_user` and `get_all_users` now **exclude password hashes** in responses.

#### ✅ Email Uniqueness Constraint

* Emails are now **UNIQUE** in the database schema.
* Duplicate entries handled with proper **409 Conflict** status.

---

### 2. 🧩 Code Organization & Maintainability

#### ✅ Scoped DB Connection via `get_db()`

* Uses Flask's `g` to ensure **request-scoped database access**.
* Added `app.teardown_appcontext` to **clean up connections**.

#### ✅ Proper Separation of Concerns

* Each route focuses on HTTP logic.
* DB logic is clearly separated and modular.

#### ✅ Configurable Settings

* Uses `DATABASE`, `SECRET_KEY`, and `DEBUG_MODE` from **environment variables**.

---

### 3. 🧠 Best Practices

#### ✅ Consistent JSON Responses

* All responses now use `jsonify()`.

#### ✅ Proper HTTP Status Codes

| Code                        | When                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `200 OK`                    | Successful GET or PUT    |
| `201 Created`               | Successful user creation |
| `204 No Content`            | Successful DELETE        |
| `400 Bad Request`           | Invalid input            |
| `401 Unauthorized`          | Failed login             |
| `404 Not Found`             | User not found           |
| `405 Method Not Allowed`    | Invalid method           |
| `409 Conflict`              | Email already exists     |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Unexpected failure       |

#### ✅ Robust Error Handling

* Centralized error handlers using `@app.errorhandler`.
* Try-except around:

  * DB operations
  * JSON parsing
  * Integrity constraints

#### ✅ Input Validation

* Required fields (`name`, `email`, `password`) are checked explicitly.
* Email validation via `validate_email()`.
* Password length check via `validate_password_strength()`.

#### ✅ Route Typing

* Routes like `/user/<int:user_id>` ensure **type safety**.

#### ✅ Removed `debug=True`

* Now driven by environment config to avoid exposure in production.

#### ✅ Logging Setup

* Basic logging added using Python's `logging` module for debugging.

## 🧪 Testing

### ✅ Conceptual Test Script (`test.py`)

* Demonstrates endpoint testing using the `requests` library.
* Covers:

  * User creation
  * Login
  * Read/update/delete
  * Error cases
* Serves as a **starting point for an automated test suite**.

---

## ⚖️ Assumptions & Trade-offs

* **SQLite** retained for simplicity, though PostgreSQL/MySQL preferred for production.
* **Authentication** (e.g., JWT or sessions) not implemented due to time constraints.
* **No secrets management tool**, just env vars (`SECRET_KEY`).
* Focus was on **critical refactors**, not exhaustive test coverage or Dockerization.
